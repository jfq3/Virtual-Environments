# Virtual-Environments
This repository includes yml files for creating virtual environments with conda.
1. genseed-hmm.yml creates an environment in which to run the perl script genseed-hmm.pl available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/genseedhmm/files/.
2. figaro.yml creates an environment in which to run the program FIGARO available at https://github.com/Zymo-Research/figaro. This program is for finding the optimal truncation lengths to use with the QIIME2 plugin DADA2. See my tutorial on processing 16S rRNA gene sequences at https://john-quensen.com/tutorials/processing-16s-sequences-with-qiime2-and-dada2/.
